# What is shilajit?
Shilajit is a fulvic-acid rich blackish-brown organic substance, which has been used as a medicinal tratment to many diseases and serves as a potent tonic. Its effects are so well recognized that some companies have tried to patent the derivitive of the substance for commercial use. 

**It goes by a few names:**

- Shlajit
- salajeet
- mumijo
- mumie

"[Shilajit is a humus rich blackish-brown substance, which is very useful in many diseases and serves as a potent tonic.](http://www.shilajit.info/sdfiles/2014_08_03Shilajit-A-Review.pdf)"

It occurs naturally as a complex mixture of organic humic substances, plant, and microbial metabolites. It is found in the area where the rock touches the root systems of plants. 

**For 3000 years it has been used as a rejuvenator and adaptogen with claims to increase energy and vitality.** According to traditional Ayurveda, "shilajit arrests the process of aging and produces rejuvenation which are two important aspects of an Ayurvedic rasayana (Ghosal, 1990)."

Over the past 20-25 years scientific studies have concluded it is indeed a type of medicine effective for a number of ailments including:

- cognitive decline (including memory)
- inflammation
- again (due to potent antioxidant effect)
- diabetes 
- stress
- allergies & allergic reactions

These benefits are likely due to it's chemical structure which consists of benzoic acid, hippuric acid, fatty acids, and humic acid (60-80%). Humic acid is also found in hummus. 

Outside of its scientifically studied benefits, Shilajit has been, and continues to be used in traditional medicines to treat:
- genital and urinary disorders 
- jaundice
- gallstones
- digestive disorders
- enlarged spleen
- epilepsy
- nervous disorder
- chronic bronchitis
- anemia

Shilajit has also been said to have potent aphrodisiac properties.
