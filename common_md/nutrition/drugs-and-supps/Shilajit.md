It goes by a few names:
- Shlajit
- salajeet
- mumijo
- mumie

"Shilajit is a humus rich blackish-brown substance, which is very useful in many diseases and serves as a potent tonic." [1] 

It occurs naturally as a complex mixture of organic humic substances, plant, and microbial metabolites. It is found in the area where the rock touches the root systems of plants. 

For 3000 years it has been used as a rejuvenator and adaptogen with claims to increase energy and vitality. According to traditional Ayurveda, "shilajit arrests the process of aging and produces rejuvenation which are two important aspects of an Ayurvedic rasayana (Ghosal, 1990)."

Over the past 20-25 years scientific studies have concluded it is indeed a type of medicine effective for a number of ailments including:

- cognitive decline (including memory)
- inflammation
- again (due to potent antioxidant effect)
- diabetes 
- stress
- allergies & allergic reactions

These benefits are likely due to it's chemical structure which consists of benzoic acid, hippuric acid, fatty acids, and humic acid (60-80%). Humic acid is also found in hummus. 

Outside of its scientifically studied benefits, Shilajit has been, and continues to be used in traditional medicines to treat:
- genital and urinary disorders 
- jaundice
- gallstones
- digestive disorders
- enlarged spleen
- epilepsy
- nervous disorder
- chronic bronchitis
