Piracetam is a substance that comes from the neurotransmitter GABA and improves many of our standard brain and body functions and may even help improve neurodegenaration. 

In our brain, it helps with communication between nerve cells and protects them. It also makes our brain more adaptable. 

In our blood vessels, it helps keep our blood cells from sticking to the vessel walls by relaxing our blood vessels, keeping them working well.

Because of this it may help with various health problems and age-related disorders. It is used to treat memory loss, dizziness, muscle jerks, reading difficulties, and a rare blood disorder called sickle cell anemia. Sometimes, people need higher doses, but it is usually safe to use.
