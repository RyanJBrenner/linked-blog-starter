# A guide to understanding active heart rate (AHR).

**Heart Rate Dynamics:**
  - Regulated by the body based on activity levels.
  - Increases during activity or stress; decreases during rest or calm states.

## Active Heart Rate (AHR):
  - Recorded during exercise, significantly higher than RHR.
  - A natural response to aerobic exercise, indicating improved cardiovascular efficiency.


## Active Heart Rate (AHR) Examples:

**Moderate Exercise AHR:** 120 bpm
  - Indicative of engaging in aerobic activities like brisk walking.

**Vigorous Exercise AHR:** 160 bpm
  - Demonstrates a higher heart rate during intense workouts.

Understanding these facts helps interpret heart rate variations, offering insights into overall well-being and fitness levels.
