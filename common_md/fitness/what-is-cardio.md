title: What is cardio?
excerpt: Cardio, short for cardiovascular -- in exercise often used as short for cardioactivity -- , is often used in fitness to reference exercise that increases resting HR to a set state.

# The Magic of Cardio

Cardio, short for cardiovascular, refers to exercises and activities that aim to enhance and maintain the health of the cardiovascular system, which includes the heart, blood vessels, and lungs. 

These activities typically involve rhythmic and sustained movements that increase the heart rate and breathing rate, promoting improved circulation and oxygen delivery throughout the body.

**Common forms of cardio exercises include**:  
1. running
2. cycling
3. swimming
4. brisk walking
5. dancing
6. aerobic workouts

The primary goal of cardio exercise is to strengthen the heart, improve lung capacity, and boost overall cardiovascular fitness. 

Engaging in regular cardio activities is associated with various health benefits, including weight management, reduced risk of heart disease, improved mood, and increased stamina.

## What Defines Cardio Activity?

At its core, cardio activity encompasses any exercise or movement that propels the heart rate above its resting state. It's the rhythmic thumping in your chest, signaling that your cardiovascular system is engaged and working efficiently. 

## How to measure cardio activity

Determining the effectiveness of your cardio activity involves knowing what you're looking for when it comes to improvement. 

Many people lean on unreliable measures to guage the effectiveness of their exercise. 

Always remember that you must perform the activity that trains the body for the outcome you seek. 

When it comes to cardio for long-term fitness, the best measures of improvement are:
1. Increasing [stroke volume](../fitness/what-is-stroke-volume): How much blood the heart is moving with each beat.
2. Decreasing [AHR](../fitness/active-heart-rate.md) and [RHR](../fitness/resting-heart-rate.md): The average beats-per-minute (BPM) measured during active or resting states. 
3. Increasing [heart rate variability](..fitness/heart-rate-variability): The average time between heart beats measured in milliseconds.

### **Secondary Measures to Guage Cardiac Activity**

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):** A medical marvel that records the electrical activity of the heart. 
2. **Watts:** A unit of power that quantifies the energy expended during cardio exercises.
3. **Heat:** The body's response to increased heart rate, dissipating heat energy from caloric expenditure.

### **Unreliable Measures to Guage Cardiac Activity**

1. **Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE):** Subjective self-assessment of exercise intensity, varying from person to person.
2. **Sweating:** While a common side effect, individual sweating patterns may not universally reflect the intensity of cardio.
3. **Thirst:** Dehydration can influence thirst, but it's not a foolproof indicator of cardio effectiveness.

## How to start with cardio:

Cardio isn't just a set of exercises; it's a lifestyle. Specifically one that promotes heart health, enhances endurance, and contributes to overall well-being. 

The most common ways to intro into regular cardio axercise are **running/jogging, cycling, swimming, and dancing**.

There are all forms of low-intensity, steady-state cardio which pose positive long-term health benefits. 

*Note: Engaging in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) without proper supervision may result in injury. Consult with a healthcare professional before embarking on any new exercise regimen.*
