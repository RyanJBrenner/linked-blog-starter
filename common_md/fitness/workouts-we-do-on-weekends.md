# Workouts we do on weekends.

Every Sunday morning we meet in Austin, Texas to explore the wonderful world of fitness. Okay, so its not really like that...

But we do meet up and workout together. 

Right now we are still small and so we ask all participants to bring their own workout gear (i.e. kettlebells, barbells, water bottle, etc.). 

Check out some workouts here to get exercise tutorials and we typically perform.
