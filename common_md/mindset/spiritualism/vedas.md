A list of scriptures written in [[Sanskrit]]. The word "veda" translates directly to `knowledge`. The original Vedas were split up into two many categories:

- Sruti `what is heard`
- Smrti `what is remembered`

This group of text informs the religion of Hinduism, (also known as Sanatan Dharma meaning 'Eternal Order' or 'Eternal Path'). It is rooted in the idea that a mantra, or a grouping of sounds with specific meaning, can be be a way of unlocking the hidden potential within all of us. 

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] is the most recognized and popular scripture within the group of Vedas known as Smrti and opens with the most well known story to all Hindus, the story of Krishna and the Indian prince, Arjuna.
