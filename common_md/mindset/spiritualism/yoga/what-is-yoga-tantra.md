# What is Yoga Trantra? 

Tantra Yoga is a modern reinterpretation of ancient Vedic and yogic practices. Unlike traditional yoga, Tantra values the body as a tool for spiritual exploration, focusing on the inner world of energy instead of detachment from the physical.

The term "Tantra" originally meant "weave or loom" but evolved to signify techniques, methods, and profound matters related to reality and sacred mantras. 

Tantra yoga weaves together various techniques like mantra meditation, visualization, mudras, pranayama, and initiation, with a primary focus on cultivating kundalini energy.

This practice revolves around the worship of Shiva and Shakti, representing dynamic and static universal principles. 

It seeks to bridge the physical and the divine by developing the subtle energy and spirit bodies, using practices like asana, pranayama, mudra, and shatkarma.

Devotional practices like mantra, yantra, and puja are used to nurture the spiritual body. 

**Mantras** are sacred sounds, **yantras** are geometric forms for concentration, and **puja** involves worship through offerings to deities.

While Tantra yoga was introduced in the West as a means to deepen intimacy, it's important to distinguish it from exotic sexual practices. The true essence of Tantra lies in its complex system of enlightenment, not just sexual techniques.

The goal of Tantra Yoga is personal experimentation and experience, aiming to cleanse the body and mind to free oneself from the constraints of physical existence. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, with the common focus of using the body as a means to connect with the sacred and experience the oneness of the cosmos.
