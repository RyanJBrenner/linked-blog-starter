The Patanjali Yoga Sutras are a collection of 196 short aphorisms (or verses) that serve as a foundational text for the philosophy and practice of yoga. They are attributed to the sage Patanjali, who is believed to have lived in India between the 2nd and 4th centuries CE. Patanjali's work is considered one of the most important texts in the tradition of classical yoga philosophy. 

The Yoga Sutras are divided into four chapters, or "padas," each of which deals with different aspects of yoga. The sutras contained therein are the cornerstones of new-age yoga.

Chapter 1: **Samadhi Pada (Chapter on Contemplation):** 
This chapter introduces the concept of yoga and outlines the goal of yoga, which is the attainment of samadhi, a state of profound meditation and realization. It also discusses various types of mental modifications (vrittis) and the importance of controlling them.

Chapte 2: **Sadhana Pada (Chapter on Practice):** 
This chapter provides guidance on the practical aspects of yoga practice. It describes the eightfold path of yoga, known as the "Ashtanga Yoga," which includes ethical principles (yamas and niyamas), physical postures (asanas), breath control (pranayama), sense withdrawal (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and absorption (samadhi).

Chapter 3: **Vibhuti Pada (Chapter on Powers):**
This chapter explores the extraordinary mental and spiritual powers that can be developed through yogic practices. It also discusses the concept of Isvara (a higher divine being or principle) and its role in yoga.

Chapter 4: **Kaivalya Pada (Chapter on Liberation):**
The final chapter discusses the ultimate goal of yoga, which is liberation or kaivalya. It explains the nature of the self (purusha) and the importance of realizing its distinctness from the ever-changing mind and body. The chapter concludes with insights into the state of absolute freedom and isolation from worldly suffering.

The Yoga Sutras are written in a concise and aphoristic style, which has led to various interpretations and commentaries by different yoga scholars and practitioners over the centuries. The text is considered a foundational work in the philosophy of yoga and is studied by those seeking a deeper understanding of the spiritual and philosophical aspects of yoga practice.
