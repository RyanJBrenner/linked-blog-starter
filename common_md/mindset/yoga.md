# The story of Patanjali 

Patanjali is a revered figure in Hindu philosophy and is often considered the 'father of yoga'. He compiled the Yoga Sutras, a collection of aphorisms on the theory and practice of yoga.

While Shiva is often considered the deity who first practiced and taught yoga, it was Patanjali who systematized these ideas and practices. In this way, Shiva's Tandav dance can be seen as symbolic of the dynamic energy that yoga seeks to harness.

The Tandav dance represents both creation and destruction - similar to many aspects of yoga which are about creating balance and harmony while destroying ignorance and ego.

However, while both figures are significant in Hindu philosophy, their stories are separate. Shiva's Tandav dance is part of his lore as a deity, while Patanjali's contributions are more focused on philosophy and practical aspects of Yoga.

### 3 Patanjali Contributions 
In the original Sanskrit text, Patanjali was said to be:

> The one who cleansed the impurities, 
> of the mind, through yoga,
> of the speech, through grammar and
> of the body, through medicine;
> I bow down with my folded palms,
> to that highest of sages, Patangali

**Patanjali Tantra** (physical health)

# Yoga in simple words

**What is Yoga?**
"Arjuna, the steadfast in the performance of your duty, and treat both Success and Failure equally. Such state of mind is called Yoga." - Bhagavad Gita 

Yoga is the process of restraining Chitta (mind) from any fluctuations. Chitta being more of a state of mind than the physical mind itself.

### Ashtanga Yoga 

Ashtanga Yoga is a specific style of yoga that was taught by the revered yogi K. Pattabhi Jois in the 20th century, and it's based on ancient yoga teachings. The name "Ashtanga" comes from Sanskrit and means "eight limbs", which refers to the eightfold path of yoga outlined in [[../Patanjali's Yoga Sutras]].

These eight limbs are:

1. **Yama** (Ethical standards)
	These are moral disciplines, including non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, not waisting energy, and not being greedy.
	
2. **Niyama** (Self-discipline and spiritual observances)
	This includes cleanliness, contentment, spiritual austerity, study of sacred scriptures and surrender to God. These are the 5 traist which one must devlope to get into Nyama yoga.
	
3. **Asana** (Posture)
	These are the physical postures practiced in yoga. This is the step that is the most popular across the world. This set the foundation. 
	
4. **Pranayama** (Breath control)
	This is the control of breath and life force. Controlling the motion of the exhalation and inhalation flows. 
	
5. **Pratyahara** (Withdrawal of senses)
	This involves control of the senses, where one detaches their external world senses towards something internal or introspective.
	
6. **Dharana** (Concentration)
	This is focused concentration; keeping attention on a single point.
	
7. **Dhyana** (Meditation)
	Building upon Dharana, this is uninterrupted concentration or meditation where an individual becomes aware without focus; the mind quietens. This is the foundation of Buddhism. 
	
8. **Samadhi** (Absorption or super consciousness)
	This is the ultimate goal of Ashtanga Yoga practice- a state of peace and bliss.

The Ashtanga Yoga method involves synchronizing breath with progressive series of postures—a process that produces intense internal heat and profuse sweating that detoxifies muscles and organs.


# The Kundalini Yoga
![[kundalini yoga.jpeg]]

Many misconceptions have been made about this type of yoga. There are multiple paths to choose in yoga, and Kundalini Yoga is only one of them. However it is considered to be the most powerful and most risky form of yoga, not taught by anyone but achieved in oneself. 

Kundalini Yoga, also known as "the yoga of awareness," is a form of yoga that aims to awaken the "Kundalini" energy that is believed to reside at the base of the spine. This energy, when awakened and channeled correctly, is believed to lead to spiritual enlightenment.

The practice combines physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation, and the chanting of mantras. Kundalini Yoga focuses on self-awareness and delivering an experience of your highest consciousness.

Here's a basic breakdown of what a Kundalini Yoga session might involve:

1. **Tuning-in** with the Adi Mantra – Chanting of mantra 'Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo' three times before starting the practice.

2. **Pranayam** or **warm-up exercises** – This could be a variety of breathing and stretching exercises.

3. **Kriya** – A series of postures paired with breath work and focusing techniques designed to produce specific effects.

4. **Relaxation** – After performing the Kriya, you'll relax your body and mind, often by lying on your back.

5. **Meditation** – The session usually ends with meditation, which may involve mantras or other focusing techniques.

Kundalini Yoga is considered one of the more spiritual types of yoga practices, and its benefits are not just physical but also psychological, helping practitioners to feel more in tune with their bodies and minds.
