Compiled in 5th century BC. It forms a part of a great epic called Mahabharata. It is attributed to a sage by the name of Yasa and contains the central doctrine of Hinduism known a the Vedanta. IT explains both reincarnation and karma. 

The idea of the **Bhagavad Gita** is that we all consist of a permanent soul living within a temporary body. 

Opening scene is a prince (Arijuna) riding into the battle with the reincarnation as Krishna is his charioteer. Arjuna is feeling heavy with sadness and doesn't want to take part in the war because he feels that the war is pointless and the death of his kinsman would be dead.
