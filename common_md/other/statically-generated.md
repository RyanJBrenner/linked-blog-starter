# Creating the future with Next.js

With Static Generation, tools like Next.js allow us to render a page mostly like it would in the browser, except all at compile time. 

In plain english this means, Next.js gives us the ability to serve the entire content on first load. 

The scripts still hydrate the page during this process, but ideally with fewer changes or no changes at all.

This, combined with the powerful technology of keyword recognition throughout the entire application, we are able to help you find the health information you're looking for faster than anyone else with a guarantee of information.
