# Intro into mental health:

Its good that you're here. It's even better that you're taking the time to read this right now. It shows to yourself that you actually care about you're mental health, and thats the first step. 

So, what is mental health? 

## Integrating Mental Health into Global Health Initiatives

[Approximately 14% of the world's disease burden is attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders, with chronic conditions like depression, common mental disorders, substance-use disorders, and psychoses playing a significant role.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61238-0/fulltext) 

These statistics have underscored the crucial intersection of mental health and public health, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches.

However, **the existing emphasis on the separate impact of mental and physical disorders** may contribute to the isolation of mental health from broader efforts to enhance overall well-being and alleviate poverty.

One key limitation highlighted in the discussion is the potential underestimation of the burden of mental disorders due to a lack of recognition of their interconnectedness with other health conditions. 

### The narrative asserts that true health cannot be achieved without considering mental health.

The reason is because mental health disorders increase the risk of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as unintentional and intentional injuries. 

Simultaneously, various health conditions elevate the risk of mental disorders, complicating the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

[This article advocates for a more holistic approach to healthcare, emphasizing the need for equitable provision of services for individuals with mental disorders.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61238-0/fulltext)

It calls for an **improvement in the quality of care for both mental and physical health conditions**, suggesting the integration of psychosocial interventions into the management of various diseases. 

The argument extends to strengthening healthcare systems, with a focus on existing programs related to HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, gender-based violence, antenatal care, childhood illnesses, and nutrition. The proposal includes the idea of allocating explicit mental health budgets for these activities.

### In conclusion, the call to action is clear: mental health should not be treated in isolation but integrated into the broader landscape of global health initiatives.
