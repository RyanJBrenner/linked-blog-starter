The idea of the **Bhagavad Gita** is that we all consist of a permanent soul living within a temporary body. 

The opening scene beigns with prince (Arijuna) riding into the battle with the reincarnation as Krishna as his charioteer. 

In this opening scene betfore the great battle, Arjuna struggles with feelings of remorse and regret as he doesn't want to take part in the killing of his fellow kinsman. 

He expresses his concerns to Krishna, to which he replies ["you grieve for those who are not worthy of grief, and yet speak words of wisdom. The wise grieves neither for the living nor for the dead"](https://human.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Literature_and_Literacy/Compact_Anthology_of_World_Literature_(Getty_and_Kwon)/03%3A_India/3.01%3A_The_Bhagavad_Gita).
