# What is auditory vegas nerve stimulation?

Also known as "auricular vagus neromodulation", or aVNS for short, auditory nerve stimulation is a non-invasive treatment that involves the stimulation of the [vagus nerve]() through the auricular (ear) area.


![Innervation of the auricle by five nerves (Watanabe et al., 2016)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/664740/fnins-15-664740-HTML-r1/image_m/fnins-15-664740-g001.jpg)

The science behind the benefits of aVNS lies in its ability to stimulate the vagus nerve, which plays a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions such as heart rate, digestion, and inflammation. By targeting the auricular area, aVNS can provide non-invasive treatment options for a range of conditions.

Some of the conditions that can potentially benefit from aVNS include chronic pain, epilepsy, depression, and anxiety. The stimulation of the vagus nerve through the auricular area helps regulate these bodily functions, offering a non-invasive alternative for treatment.

## How else to get these benefits

Apart from aVNS, you may be able to get these benefits using other approaches of vagus nerve stimulation, [such as deep breathing exercises](), [meditation](), and [yoga](). These practices can also help regulate bodily functions and promote overall well-being.

These practices can also stimulate the vagus nerve, regulate bodily functions, and enhance overall well-being.
