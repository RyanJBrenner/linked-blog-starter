# What is dry eye disease? 

Dry eye disease (DED) is a common and growing concern in eye care, affecting 25% of patients in ophthalmic clinics. [Originally termed "Keratoconjunctivitis sicca" by Henrik SC Sjögren](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/opth.s5555), it was initially thought to be just eye dryness due to reduced tear production. However, in 1995, it was redefined as a complex condition caused by decreased tear production or increased tear evaporation. 

The [International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-ocular-surface/vol/15/issue/3) in 2007 further refined this definition, describing DED as a **multifactorial disease impacting tears and the ocular surface, leading to discomfort, visual issues, tear film instability, and potential ocular surface damage**. 

### Triggers
DED can be episodic, triggered by environmental factors or visual tasks, or chronic, persisting even without these triggers.

### Symptopms 
Symptoms include burning, stinging, grittiness, and a sensation of dryness or foreign bodies in the eye.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis can be based on patient symptoms or signs observed by healthcare professionals.

## How does the eye make tears?

The tear system, functioning like an automatic irrigation system, comprises glands and ducts that manage lacrimal fluid (tears) across the eyes. 

Its main functions include lubricating ocular tissues (like the conjunctiva and cornea) and flushing out foreign materials such as allergens or dust. 

The tear production process is controlled by the facial nerve. Tears originate in the lacrimal glands located in the upper outside corners of the eyes, primarily composed of salt and water. 

Blinking spreads this fluid across the eyes, where it mixes with oils from the meibomian glands to form tears. These oils prevent rapid evaporation and leakage over eyelashes.

### The anatomy of the tear system includes several components:

**Lacrimal Glands:** Produce the salty water component of tears.

**Meibomian Glands:** Located on eyelid edges, these glands release oil that mixes with the water to form tears, helping them cling to the eyes.

**Lacrimal Puncta:** These are drainage points in both the upper and lower eyelids that pump out used tears.

**Lacrimal Sacs:** These act as reservoirs, collecting tears drained from the eyes and preventing constant flooding of the tear ducts.

**Nasolacrimal Ducts (Tear Ducts):** They drain old tears into the back of the nose. Excessive tear flow, as in crying, can lead to a stuffy feeling due to tears flowing into the back of the nose and draining into the throat.


## How to stimulate tear production naturally

To obtain similar benefits to those offered by the iTEAR®100, individuals can also consider using: 

1. artificial tears
2. practicing good eyelid hygiene
3. using humidifiers
4. avoiding irritants
5. maintain a balanced diet rich in Omega-3 fatty acids

These measures can help alleviate dry eye symptoms and promote overall eye health.


## Medical device options:

### iTEAR®100

The [iTEAR®100 medical device](https://olympicophthalmics.com "nofollow") can be used for treating dry eye disease. It works by stimulating the external nasal nerve, which triggers increased tear production naturally.


**Benefits:**
The science behind the iTEAR®100 is based on the stimulation of the external nasal nerve, which leads to an increase in tear production. This innovative approach has proven to be effective for many individuals, including [Bryan Johnson](https://www.instagram.com/bryanjohnson_/?hl=en), who experienced significant improvements in his dry eye symptoms and overall eye health. With its focus on promoting eye health, the iTEAR®100 is a valuable medical device in the treatment of dry eye disease.
