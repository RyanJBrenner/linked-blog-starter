# General Heart Rate Dynamics:
Heart rate is regulated autmatically by the body based on activity (and fitness) levels.

Heart rate will increase during activity or times of stress, and will decreases during rest or relaxed states.

## Resting Heart Rate Examples:

**Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** 
  - The normal range is 60â€“100 bpm.
  - Athletes or highly fit individuals often have RHR well below 60 bpm, sometimes in the 30s.

**Normal RHR:** 
  - 70 bpm
  - Common for individuals at rest, not engaged in physical activity.

**Athlete's RHR:** 
  - 55 bpm
  - Reflects a well-conditioned cardiovascular system.

## Resting Heart Rate (RHR) Calculation:
The maximum heart rate is determined by subtracting your age from 220. For instance, for a 50-year-old, the maximum heart rate would be 220 minus 50, equaling 170 beats per minute. If aiming for a 50 percent exertion level, the target heart rate would be 50 percent of the maximum, amounting to 85 beats per minute.

Understanding these facts helps interpret heart rate variations, offering insights into overall well-being and fitness levels.
