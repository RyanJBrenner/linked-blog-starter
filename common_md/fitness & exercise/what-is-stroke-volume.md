title: "What is stroke volume?"
excerpt: "Stroke volume is the amount of blood ejected from the heart's left ventricle with each beat. It is calculated by subtracting the end-systolic volume (ESV) from the end-diastolic volume."

# Stroke Volume in Cardiology: A Quick Guide

## What is Stroke Volume?
Stroke volume is the amount of blood ejected from the heart's left ventricle per beat, a vital measure in cardiovascular health.

### Calculating Cardiac Output

\[CO = SV \times HR\]

Cardiac output is reported in liters per minute.

### Calculating Stroke Volume
\[SV = EDV - ESV\]

**End-Systolic Volume (ESV):**
Volume at the end of ventricular contraction.

**End-Diastolic Volume (EDV):**
Volume at the end of ventricular filling.

### Measuring Stroke Volume

- **Catheterization:** Special catheters for precise measurements.
  
- **Echocardiography:** Ultrasound for ventricular volume assessment.

- **Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR):** Accurate left ventricular volume measurements.

- **Nuclear Medicine Scans:** Additional diagnostic insights.

- **Wearable Technologies:** Estimates through various technologies.


## Exercise Impact on Stroke Volume

During exercise, stroke volume remains stable, gradually reducing (cardiovascular drift). Heart rate increases to meet muscle demands.
