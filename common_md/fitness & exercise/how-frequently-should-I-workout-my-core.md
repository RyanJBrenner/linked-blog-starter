# Importance of Core Strength

![](attachments/i-wish-i-had-abs.png)

If you don't have them now, chances are you wish you did. Why? Well, not ONLY because it looks good. 

Our core is one of the most crucial muscle groups in the body, influencing mobility, posture, and injury prevention. 

From daily activities to regular workouts, core strength is integral. This means making it a priority to practice functional core strengthening movements regularly.

## The "core" muscles involved

Situated in the abdominal region, the core, often known as "abs," comprises four main muscles:

1. Transverse Abdominus
   
2. Rectus Abdominis
   
3. External Oblique Muscles
   
4. Internal Oblique Muscles

## There are 3 planes of motion

Exercise involves three planes: 

1. frontal (forward / backward)
   
2. sagittal (sideways)
   
3. transverse (rotational)

Exercises that move the body in these directions involve the muscles listed above. And these muscles, when activated, move the body in the directions specified above.

## Functional Approach to Core Training

Trainers focus on exercises that indirectly target abs, enhancing overall workout gains. 

For instance, **incorporating dual kettlebell farmers carry** during a lower-body workout builds compression resistance, benefiting core strength and posture.

Explore a variety of exercises in our [7-Day Abs Workout](./7-Day-Abs-Workout) for a comprehensive core workout.

## Abs Training: Singular Focus

Core workouts **target global and local stabilizing muscles**, enhancing bending, leaning, reaching, and turning abilities. 

Abs training involves **targeted exercises** like crunches and sit-ups. The goal is to emphasize load and intensity. 

Core workouts can also be developed as a **standalone workout, or as part of a larger program**.

## Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type of Core Training

Training the core **2-3 times per week is recommended for gradual strength improvement**. 

Typically completed in **3-4 sets, with 3-4 exercises, lasting up to 30 seconds or a max of 20 reps**. 

Evaluate a training plan by considering if it **mimics daily movements, sport-specific actions, and improves daily tasks**.

## Daily Core Training Considerations

If training daily, modify the focus to different planes of motion each day to prevent overuse, imbalance, or interference with other workouts.

1. **Mimic Daily Movements:** Ensure exercises replicate daily activities.
   
2. **Sport-Specific Training:** Align training with sport-specific movements.
   
3. **Task Improvement:** Assess if exercises enhance daily tasks.

## Daily Training Caution

If training daily, be mindful of where you're starting, and where you're trying to get to. Be cautious of the following signs and adjust accordingly. 

1. **Low-Back Pain:** Sagittal exercises may lead to low-back pain, supplement with low-back exercises.

2. **Weak Lats Impact:** Beware of shoulder or trap pain, especially with fast movements or heavy loads, addressing weak lats.
