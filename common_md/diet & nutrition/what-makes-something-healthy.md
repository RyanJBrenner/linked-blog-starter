## Definition of healthy foods

The scientific definition of healthy food can vary based on the context and specific criteria considered by researchers and health experts. 

Generally speaking, _healthy foods_ are items that **provide essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals** in appropriate proportions.

Healthy foods promote overall well-being and preventing the risk of diet-related diseases. 

## How to gauge your food's health:

1. **Nutrient Density:** 
   
   Healthy foods are often rich in essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants relative to their calorie content. Nutrient-dense foods provide a high concentration of beneficial nutrients without excessive calories.

2. **Balanced Macronutrients:** 
   
   A healthy diet includes an appropriate balance of macronutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The quality and types of fats and carbohydrates are also considered.

3. **Minimally Processed:** 
   
   Whole, minimally processed foods are generally considered healthier than heavily processed or refined options. Processing methods can affect the nutritional content and may introduce additives or preservatives.

4. **Low in Added Sugars and Salt:** 
   
   Healthy foods typically have limited added sugars and salt. Excessive consumption of added sugars and sodium is associated with various health issues, including cardiovascular diseases and obesity.

5. **Dietary Guidelines Compliance:** 
   
   Healthy foods align with established dietary guidelines or recommendations provided by health organizations. These guidelines may vary by region but generally emphasize a variety of nutrient-rich foods.

6. **Bioavailability:** Healthy foods provide nutrients in forms that are easily absorbed and utilized by the body. The bioavailability of nutrients influences their effectiveness in supporting bodily functions.

7. **Evidence-Based Health Benefits:** Scientific studies and research support the health benefits of certain foods. These benefits may include reducing the risk of chronic diseases, supporting cognitive function, and promoting overall health.

It's important to note that individual dietary needs can vary based on factors such as age, sex, health conditions, and activity levels. Therefore, the definition of healthy food is often personalized, and dietary recommendations may differ for specific populations. Additionally, scientific understanding of nutrition evolves over time, leading to updates in dietary guidelines and recommendations.
