This portion of the guide is designed to give you a better understanding of your overall nutritional requirements and help you make more mindful decision of what you eat everyday.

## 1. Serving Information
All the nutrient amounts shown on the label, including the number of calories, **refer to the size of the serving**. Pay attention to the serving size, especially how many servings there are in the food package.

## 2. Calories
A calorie is a unit of measurement defined as **the heat required to raise 1kg of water by 1 degree C**. In the body, calories are used to represent the potential energy within food. To achieve or maintain a healthy body weight try to balance the number of calories you eat (and drink) with the number of calories your body uses.

## 3. Nutrients 
Can be described as a substance that is **essential for the growth, development, and maintenance of the body**. They are often described in two broad types, macro- and micro- nutrients. 

## 4. Percent Daily Value (%DV)
The percentage of the Daily Value for each nutrient in a serving of the food. The Daily Values are **reference amounts (expressed in grams, milligrams, or micro-grams) of nutrients** to consume (or not exceed) per day.
