### What is Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ)

Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a newly discovered redox cofactor in human milk that acts as an antioxidant, protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage in rat liver. 

However, in cell cultures, PQQ caused cell death due to the generation of hydrogen peroxide during autoxidation. PQQ's effects vary depending on the biological system, highlighting its varied reactivities and potential as both an antioxidant and a pro-oxidant.

### Key Takeaways

- PQQ is a redox cofactor found in human milk.
  
- It functions as an antioxidant and redox modulator, 
  protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage.
  
- PQQ prevents lipid peroxidation, protein 
  carbonyl formation, and inactivation of the 
  mitochondrial respiratory chain.
  
- In cell cultures, PQQ caused extensive cell death.
  
- The cell death effect of PQQ was due to the 
  generation of hydrogen peroxide during its autoxidation.
  
- The presence of catalase inhibited the detrimental effects of PQQ.
  
- PQQ's reactivity and function can vary in different biological systems, 
  acting as either an antioxidant or a pro-oxidant.
